Websites I like:
1.	http://codedoodl.es
This website is well designed, the layout is good and it the interaction of ui is comfortable.
2.	http://www.zefrank.com/scribbler/scribblertoo/
This website is a canvas that allows user to paint with connected lines. It can make good visual effect and give user good experience.

3.	http://rosa-menkman.blogspot.com/2010/02/glitch-studies-manifesto.html
It’s a personal blog about glitch art. I can see many kinds of glitch effect and like a ‘sick’ website which make it unique. It also have some interactions with mouse, the mouse can cause some animation. And I like the black white color.


Websites I dislike:
1.	https://www.taobao.com
    This website has too many information and ads for goods, always it distract me from what I’m preparing to research and sometimes waste time. I think it would be better if the layout can be more clean.

2.	http://www.sipcn.com/wordscanbeweapons/
Also the animation of the gun is interesting, I think the layout of the title is not comfortable.
